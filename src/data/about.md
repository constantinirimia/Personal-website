I am a software engineer that loves building things that could have a positive impact to everything that surrounds us. Data structures and algorithms help me accomplish that.

I am interested projects that involve Machine learning and Artificial intelligence as I believe sooner than later we will get to the point where technology will improve our lives majorly.

I love traveling and I plan to add many more countries and destinations on my list. Feel free to check [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/2/edit?mid=1qdMAwmzsl4e_JyVuC4dIOBhBEVAnOLBu&ll=22.96412624055243%2C-64.83993735000001&z=3) of where I wandered so far.
